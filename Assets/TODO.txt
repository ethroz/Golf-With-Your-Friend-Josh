Ease camera around
    ease to current position
    always look at focus point

golf ball LODs?
Fix the ball physics if at all
    As ball rolls faster, more energy is absorbed by the speed of rotation.
    Hitting a corner should average the ray reflections to get the correct deflection
Ball average reflection from all collisions
Make graphics quality settings better -> fix LODs so that LOD biases can be used
Fix frame rate?
    Haunted house and lake are the biggest frame hogs
Add grass
